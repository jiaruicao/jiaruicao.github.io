👋 **Hello World!**

Welcome to my very first blog post on this brand-new personal website, proudly hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/)! 🚀

For the longest time, I thought creating a sleek personal website would be awesome—but also **super complicated**. Turns out, it’s much easier than I imagined. In fact, I built and launched this site **in just half a day**. 💻⏱️

Here’s how I did it, step by step:

---

## 1️⃣ Set Up GitHub Pages

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) lets you host one free personal website per GitHub username. 🙌

To get started:
- Create a repository named `username.github.io`
- Add an `index.html` file as your homepage

That’s it! 🔧 For full instructions, check out the [GitHub Pages quickstart guide](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart).

## 2️⃣ Make It Pretty with Jekyll

[Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) is a static site generator that integrates beautifully with GitHub Pages. It supports themes, templates, and blog features out of the box. ✨

There are tons of great [Jekyll themes](https://jekyll-themes.com/), and I chose [**Chirpy**](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy) for its clean design and blogging support. 🐦

Here’s what I did:

1. Cloned the Chirpy repo: [`https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy`](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy)
2. Copied all the files into my `username.github.io` repo
3. Committed and pushed 🚀

Just like that, I had a beautiful website live on the internet!

## 3️⃣ Customize the Pages

Once the structure was in place, I started customizing the content to make it my own. ✍️

Here’s what I changed:

- 🛠️ Edited `_config.yml` to include my name, avatar, and social links
- 🙋 Edited `_tabs/about.md` to write an “About Me” section
- 📝 Wrote this blog post by adding a Markdown file in the `_posts/` folder
- 📂 Added a **Projects** tab and created individual pages for each project

💡 **Pro Tip:** [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) was super helpful in guiding me through Chirpy’s structure—especially which files to edit and how to preview changes locally.
